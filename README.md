# Social Network Feed Algorithm

This is a sample project that demonstrates how to build a custom feed algorithm for a social network platform using C# and .NET.

## Installation

To run the project, you will need to have the .NET Core SDK installed. You can download it from the official .NET website: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download

Once you have the .NET Core SDK installed, you can clone this repository and open the project in Visual Studio or another .NET IDE.

## Usage

To use the feed algorithm, you can create an instance of the `FeedPresenter` class and call its `DisplayFeed` method, passing in the ID of the user whose feed you want to display:

```csharp
var presenter = new FeedPresenter();
presenter.DisplayFeed(userId);
```

This will display the top-ranked posts in the user's feed, filtered by their interests and sorted by the number of likes they have received.
You can customize this file to suit your project's needs. Be sure to include instructions on how to install and use the project, as well as any licensing or contribution information.
